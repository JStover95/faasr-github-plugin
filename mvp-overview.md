# FaaSr GitHub Plugin MVP Overview

This GitHub plugin is an extension of the existing FaaSr framework. Refer to [faasr-docs/docs](./faasr-docs/docs/) for details on the FaaSr framework.

## User Stories

I am a researcher with R and Python scripts that I want to run at scheduled intervals to process data. I created a workflow via the FaaSr Workflow Builder UI and upload it to my FaaSr-workflow repository.
