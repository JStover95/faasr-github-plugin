# FaaSr GitHub App Design Docs

These design docs are mean to be a single source of truth for documenting proven design patterns, architecture decisions, and testing strategies. These documents should be living and adaptable, being updated, redacted, or added to regularly as new design patterns or architecture decisions are made.

Documents should be brief, focused, and concise for the easy consumption of coding agents without context saturation.
